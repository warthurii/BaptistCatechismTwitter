# Daily Baptist Twitter Bot
## Purpose
Purpose of this repo is to provide source code for a twitter bot (@dailybaptist1). The core functionality will be posting text from  historical baptist sources
daily. The main source will be the baptist catechism for now but would like to do the confession. Other ideas for the bot are welcome.

## Setup
 1. Twitter profile
  - First need a twitter account.
 2. Then set up a twitter develop accoutn with that account. I recommend getting elevated access to use v1 and v2 endpoints.
 3. Set your api, access, and client keys.
  - I use a shell script (as I am on ubuntu) to set the keys/tokens as environment variables which are called from the python code.
 4. Should be ready run the main program (baptistBot.py)
